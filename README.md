### 🧠 **Learns You**
- **Mimics Style:** Learns your vocabulary, tone, and speaking style to respond just like you would.
- **Personalized:** Adapts its personality based on your interactions.
- **Private:** All learning happens locally on your machine. Your personality never leaves your device.

### 👻 **Ghost Agent (Autonomous Coding)**
- **Vibe Coding:** Can inspect your local code, fix bugs, and implement features autonomously.
- **Terminal Access:** Executes commands to build, test, and deploy your projects.
- **GitHub Integration:** Manages your repositories and pushes code for you.

### 🎯 **Proactive Assistant**
- **Shopping:** Finds the best deals and coupon codes automatically.
- **Travel:** Searches flights and hotels to find the best options.
- **Fitness:** Creates personalized workout plans and schedules reminders.
- **Daily Life:** Manages your calendar, sets reminders, and monitors prices.

### 🎤 **Voice & Interaction**
- **Real-Time Voice:** Talk to Echo naturally with realistic interruptions and diverse voices.
- **Voice Cloning:** Clones voices (encrypted) for a personalized experience.
- **Stealth Mode:** A discreet UI for when you need help without being obvious.

## 🔐 Privacy-First Design

Echo is built with a "Local-First" philosophy:
- ✅ **Local Storage:** All memories, voice samples, and learning data are stored on your device (IndexedDB).
- ✅ **Encrypted:** Sensitive data is encrypted at rest.
- ✅ **No Eavesdropping:** Voice processing (VAD) happens locally.
